    <p class="main-screen__periodbio">When I closed the doors on Website Design at the end of 2021, I began working on my Software Engineering skills. The only way to do software engineering is to keep learning. Here is an overview of my education along with a few of the classes I've taken recently:</p>

        <p>Bachelor of Arts Computer Science</p>
        <p>Starting in a single high school programming class, it was quickly evident that I had a knack for figuring out the intracacies of computer programming. This degree still serves me well providing me with a phenomenal basis for all knowledge needed to keep up with computer technologies even today.</p>

She was interested in all aspects of the website, had many detailed requests, and challenged the SEO of the site at every turn. We worked together to get her website to show at the top of the google search and get business launched. She is flourishing now and has hired multiple people over the last two years to handle the increased customers.</p>
          <p class="logo-columns__second-desc"><strong>Bon Mot PR.</strong> This public relations firm needed their website moved to a different platform but didn't have access to the data or the original website.

I used the socket interface, before the more standardized versions were developed to communicate with the server software and continuued to create a printer driver that would allow windows users to send faxes from any installed software.
